## Setup a local Cardano network and provider using Docker
*WIP. Consider this a preview of the intended workflow* 

A local Cardano network and provider can be spun up using the Docker Stack we maintain, or your own definition referencing the Docker images and configuration individually. This allows your application to run full e2e tests against Cardano in a local development environment, or to quickly evaluate the SDK however you see fit.

System requirements: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

1. `git clone {Todo: INSERT REPOSITORY URI}`
2. `cd {Todp: INSERT DIRNAME}`
3. `docker-compose up`
