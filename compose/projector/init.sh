# To init a postgres container db, the initdb.d can be used.
# Ref: "Initialization scripts" in https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
# The problem using this clean and built-in approach is this is executed only once,
# when the database is created the first time.
# In order to apply changes to the db schemas using this approach would require an
# explicit DROP of all the databases by the user with two great drawbacks:
# a) it requires an opartion by hand
# b) it would require to resync from genesis

# The custom approach adopted doesn't requires any actions by the user and allows
# changes between versions of the SDK.

# This is not a 'real' while loop: the fail of init.sql should be caused by the lack
# of the database, which is created inside the loop; next check should succeed.
