/**
 * Distributing change is related to a class of problems called "multiway number partitioning", which is NP-hard. If the problem
 * size is small (such as is our case), more exact methods such as dynamic programming or integer programming could be used,
 * but since this is still a POC, for simplicityâ€™s sake, we are implementing a simplified and iterative approach to
 * solve this:
 *
 * 1 - Sort the change list in descending order. The reason to sort is to allocate the largest change outputs first to
 * the 'buckets' with the largest gap, and the smaller outputs to the buckets with smaller gaps, reducing wasted change (over flow).
 * 2 - For each change output, add it to the bucket that currently has the largest gap and is not overflowed.
 * 3 - Repeat until all change outputs are in a bucket.
 *
 * This will yield a reasonable approximation to the optimal distribution of change, giving priority to buckets with larger
 * gaps, but at the same time making sure we are not 'wasting' change by overflowing a single bucket too much.
 *
 * TODO: Explore more exact algorithms for change distribution. The approach we have followed here is a greedy heuristic, which can
 * provide reasonable solutions quickly but is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution. It might be feasible to use a more
 * rigorous approach such as integer programming, simulated annealing, or a complete search, which could examine all possible
 * assignments of change outputs to buckets and select the one that most closely matches the desired proportions. However,
 * these methods can be computationally intensive and may not be practical, and probably overkill for our use case (To be determined).
 *
 * @param changeOutputs The list of change outputs to be distributed.
 * @param prefilledBuckets The list of buckets, we should have one bucket per entry in the delegation distribution portfolio.
 * @returns A list of buckets with the given change outputs distributed in a way that closely matches the expected distribution (best effort).
