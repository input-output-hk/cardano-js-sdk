/**
 * Provides a mechanism to discover addresses in Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets

 *
 * - Derive base addresses with payment credential at index 0 and increasing stake credential until it reaches the given limit.
 * - Derives base addresses with increasing payment credential and stake credential at index 0.
 * - if no transactions are found for both internal and external address type, increase the gap count.
 * - if there are some transactions, increase the payment credential index and set the gap count to 0.
 * - if the gap count reaches the given lookAheadCount stop the discovery process.
 *
 * Please note that the algorithm works with the transaction history, not balances, so you can have an address with 0 total coins
 * and the algorithm will still continue with discovery if the address was previously used.
 *
 * If the wallet hits gap limit of unused addresses in a row, it expects there are
 * no used addresses beyond this point and stops searching the address chain.
