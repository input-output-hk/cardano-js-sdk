# Cardano JS SDK | Wallet | Test

Running these suites requires both a supported Ledger and Trezor device to be plugged in via USB. You may need to
install udev rules, if running on Linux, which can be done by using the script documented in
[Download and Install Ledger Live docs], and via the [Trezor Suite] UI.

## Quick Setup

For automated setup of the hardware testing environment:

```bash
# Set up Trezor testing environment
./scripts/setup-hw-testing.sh

# Install Trezor Bridge only
./scripts/install-trezor-bridge.sh
```
