/**
 * A transaction is a record of value transfer between two or more addresses on the network. It represents a request
 * to modify the state of the blockchain, by transferring a certain amount of ADA or a native asset from one address
 * to another. Each transaction includes inputs and outputs, where the inputs represent the addresses that are sending
 * ADA or the native asset, and the outputs represent the addresses that are receiving ADA or the native asset.
 *
 * To ensure the security and integrity of the Cardano blockchain, each transaction is cryptographically signed using
 * the private key of the sender's address, which proves that the sender has authorized the transaction.
 *
 * Additionally, each transaction on the Cardano blockchain can also carry metadata, which can be used to include
 * additional information about the transaction, such as a description or a reference to a specific product or service.
